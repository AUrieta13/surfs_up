## Summary:
When comparing both June and December temperature data, it is obvious that the temperature decreases slighty in the month of December. Although the temperature does decrease slighty during December, the average temperature during that month is very similar to the month of June. This must conclude that the temperature during both months stays relatively consistent with an occasional temperature decrease during December.
